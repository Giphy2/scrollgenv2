# NFT Marketplace Performance Optimization

## Problem Identified

The NFT Marketplace was taking a long time to load due to an inefficient smart contract implementation in the `getActiveListings()` function.

### Original Implementation (Slow)
```solidity
function getActiveListings(uint256 offset, uint256 limit) {
    uint256 maxTokenId = 10000;

    // Problem: Loops through ALL 10,000 possible token IDs
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < maxTokenId && count < limit; i++) {
        if (listings[i].active && count >= offset) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    // ... more loops
}
```

**Performance Issue:**
- Scanned 10,000 token IDs every single query
- 10,000+ blockchain reads even if only 5 NFTs were listed
- Took several seconds to load marketplace

---

## Solution Implemented

### Smart Contract Optimization

Added efficient tracking system to only store and query active listings:

```solidity
// New state variables
uint256[] private activeListingIds;
mapping(uint256 => uint256) private activeListingIndex;

// Optimized function
function getActiveListings(uint256 offset, uint256 limit) {
    uint256 totalActive = activeListingIds.length;  // Instant count!

    // Only loop through actual listings
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        uint256 tokenId = activeListingIds[offset + i];
        // Direct lookup - no scanning
    }
}
```

### Helper Functions Added

1. **`_addToActiveListings(tokenId)`** - Called when NFT is listed
   - Adds token ID to tracking array
   - Records its position in the index mapping

2. **`_removeFromActiveListings(tokenId)`** - Called when NFT is sold/cancelled
   - Uses swap-and-pop pattern for O(1) removal
   - Updates index mapping

3. **`getActiveListingsCount()`** - Returns total active listings instantly
   - Simple array length query
   - No loops needed

## Performance Improvement

| Scenario | Old Performance | New Performance | Speedup |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| 5 listings | 10,000 reads | 5 reads | **2,000x faster** |
| 50 listings | 10,000 reads | 50 reads | **200x faster** |
| 500 listings | 10,000 reads | 500 reads | **20x faster** |

## Frontend Implementation

### New NFTMarketplace Component

Created comprehensive marketplace UI with:

**Features:**
- ✅ Browse all active listings with instant loading
- ✅ View your owned NFTs
- ✅ List NFTs for sale with custom pricing
- ✅ Buy listed NFTs with SGT tokens
- ✅ Cancel your active listings
- ✅ Real-time marketplace statistics
- ✅ Automatic approval handling for NFTs and tokens

**Views:**
1. **Browse Marketplace** - See all available NFTs for sale
2. **My NFTs** - Manage and list your Genesis Badges
3. **My Listings** - Track and cancel your active listings

**Stats Dashboard:**
- Total active listings
- Floor price
- Marketplace fee (2.5%)

## Files Modified

### Smart Contracts
- `/contracts/NFTMarketplace.sol` - Optimized listing queries

### Frontend
- `/frontend/src/components/NFTMarketplace.jsx` - New marketplace UI component
- `/frontend/src/App.jsx` - Added marketplace tab
- `/frontend/src/config-phase2.js` - Updated ABIs with new functions

---

## How It Works

### Listing an NFT
1. User selects NFT from "My NFTs" view
2. Enters price in SGT tokens
3. Contract approves marketplace if needed
4. NFT transferred to marketplace escrow
5. Token ID added to `activeListingIds[]` array

### Buying an NFT
1. User browses marketplace (instant load!)
2. Clicks "Buy Now" on desired NFT
3. Contract approves SGT spending if needed
4. SGT transferred: 97.5% to seller, 2.5% marketplace fee
5. NFT transferred to buyer
6. Token ID removed from `activeListingIds[]` array

### Loading Marketplace
1. Query `getActiveListings(0, 50)` - returns first 50 listings
2. Only reads data for actually listed NFTs
3. No wasted blockchain reads
4. Instant results!

## Technical Details

### Array Management

**Adding to array:**
```solidity
function _addToActiveListings(uint256 tokenId) private {
    activeListingIndex[tokenId] = activeListingIds.length;
    activeListingIds.push(tokenId);
}
```

**Removing from array (swap-and-pop):**
```solidity
function _removeFromActiveListings(uint256 tokenId) private {
    uint256 index = activeListingIndex[tokenId];
    uint256 lastIndex = activeListingIds.length - 1;

    if (index != lastIndex) {
        uint256 lastTokenId = activeListingIds[lastIndex];
        activeListingIds[index] = lastTokenId;
        activeListingIndex[lastTokenId] = index;
    }

    activeListingIds.pop();
    delete activeListingIndex[tokenId];
}
```

### Gas Optimization

- Array operations are O(1) constant time
- No expensive loops on-chain
- Efficient memory usage
- Minimal gas costs for listing/delisting

## Testing

To test the marketplace:

1. **Stake SGT tokens** to earn Genesis Badge NFTs
2. **Wait for eligibility** (Bronze tier = 100 SGT for 1 day)
3. **Claim your badge** in the NFT Staking interface
4. **Navigate to Marketplace tab**
5. **List your NFT** with a price in SGT
6. **Browse listings** - should load instantly!
7. **Buy/Cancel** - test full marketplace flow

---

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements:

1. **Supabase Integration** - Index listings off-chain for advanced filtering
2. **Search & Filter** - By tier, price range, seller
3. **Price History** - Track sales over time
4. **Offer System** - Allow buyers to make offers below list price
5. **Auction System** - Time-limited bidding on rare tiers
6. **Royalties** - Original minter gets % of secondary sales

---

## Conclusion

The marketplace now loads **instantly** regardless of total NFT supply, providing a smooth user experience comparable to centralized marketplaces like OpenSea, while remaining fully decentralized and on-chain.
