- ✅ Ownership verified before unstaking
- ✅ Rewards proportional to tier and time

### B. Lending & Borrowing

**LendingProtocol.sol**
- ⚠️ Interest rate model not implemented
- ⚠️ Liquidation mechanism incomplete
- ⚠️ Collateral ratio checks missing
- ❌ **Blocker:** Requires price oracle integration

3. Integrate Chainlink price feeds
4. Add health factor calculations

### C. NFT Marketplace

**NFTMarketplace.sol**
- ✅ Proper ERC721 transfer checks
- ✅ Royalty payments to creator
- ✅ Marketplace fee reasonable (2.5%)
- ⚠️ No offer/bid system (future enhancement)

### D. Bridge & Cross-Chain

**BridgeConnector.sol & ScrollGenBridge.sol**
- ⚠️ Centralized validator (owner)
- ⚠️ No fraud proof mechanism
- ⚠️ Lock/unlock pattern needs audit
- ❌ **Blocker:** Requires security audit before mainnet

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement multi-sig validation
2. Add challenge period for withdrawals
3. Use canonical token bridge when possible
4. Consider LayerZero/Axelar integration

### E. AI Yield Manager

**AIYieldManager.sol**
- ✅ Pool metrics properly validated
- ✅ Rebalancing proposal expiry (1 hour)
- ✅ User strategy validation
- ⚠️ AI oracle is centralized
- ⚠️ No slippage protection on rebalancing

### F. Zero-Knowledge Identity

**zkIDVerifier.sol**
- ⚠️ ZK proof validation is mocked
- ❌ **Blocker:** Requires real ZK verifier contract
- ✅ Soulbound NFT properly implemented
- ✅ ScrollPower accounting correct

**Recommendations:**
1. Integrate production ZK proof system (Groth16/PLONK)
2. Add proof generation documentation
3. Implement trusted setup ceremony
4. Add proof caching to prevent DoS

### G. Quest & Gamification

**QuestSystem.sol**
- ✅ Quest completion logic sound
- ✅ Badge minting properly restricted
- ✅ Experience calculations correct
- ✅ Cannot claim same quest twice

## 6. Centralization Risks

### Identified Centralization Points

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Status |
|------|----------|------------|--------|
| Owner can pause contracts | High | Use Timelock + Multi-sig | ⏳ Pending |

| ZK verifier trusted | High | Implement verification layer | ⏳ Pending |
| Bridge validator single address | Critical | Multi-sig + fraud proofs | ❌ Blocker |
| Reward rate changes instant | Medium | Add timelock delays | ⏳ Pending |

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Deploy TimelockController for owner actions
2. Transfer ownership to multi-sig (Gnosis Safe)
3. Implement 2-day timelock for critical changes
4. Add emergency pause with 7-day cooldown

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simpler security model
- ✅ No proxy vulnerabilities
- ✅ No storage collision risks

**Cons:**
- ❌ Cannot fix bugs post-deployment
- ❌ Cannot add features

**Recommendation:**
- Deploy new versions alongside old

## 9. Security Assumptions

### Trust Model

1. **Admin Trust:** Protocol admin is trusted to:
   - Set reasonable reward rates
   - Register valid pools
   - Not rug-pull treasury funds

2. **Oracle Trust:** AI oracle and zkID verifier are trusted to:
   - Provide accurate data
   - Not manipulate metrics
   - Remain online

3. **User Trust:** Users trust that:
   - Smart contracts execute as documented
   - No hidden backdoors exist
   - Audits are accurate

### Threat Model

**In Scope:**
- Smart contract vulnerabilities
- Economic attacks
- Oracle manipulation
- Front-running

**Out of Scope:**
- Frontend security
- Private key management
- Social engineering
- Regulatory compliance

## Conclusion

ScrollGen v2.0 demonstrates solid security practices with proper use of OpenZeppelin libraries, reentrancy guards, and access controls. However, **several critical issues must be addressed before mainnet launch**:

1. Bridge security requires multi-sig and fraud proofs
2. ZK proof system needs production implementation
3. Lending protocol needs oracle integration
4. Admin actions require timelock governance

**Recommendation:** Complete critical fixes, obtain external audit, then proceed with staged mainnet rollout.
