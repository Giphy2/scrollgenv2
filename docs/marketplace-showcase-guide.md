## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient SGT Balance"
**Solution:** Mint more SGT tokens
```bash
# In the UI: Token tab ‚Üí Mint Tokens
# Amount: 20000 SGT
```

### "Not Eligible Yet"
**Issue:** Time hasn't advanced properly
**Solution:** This shouldn't happen in the script, but if it does:
```bash
# Wait the required duration on mainnet
# Or use the script which auto-advances time
```

### "Transaction Failed"
**Common Causes:**
1. Not enough ETH for gas
2. Contract not deployed
3. Wrong network (switch to Scroll Sepolia)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check your network
# Get more testnet ETH from faucet
# Verify contracts are deployed
npm run interact:phase2
```

### "No badges appear in Marketplace UI"
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check wallet is connected
3. Verify you're on correct network
4. Check browser console for errors

---

## Alternative: Manual Minting (For Understanding)

If you want to manually mint badges without the script:

### Method 1: Through Staking UI

1. **Stake Tokens**
   - Go to "Staking" tab
   - Enter amount (e.g., 100 SGT for Bronze)
   - Click "Stake"

2. **Wait for Duration**
   - Bronze: 1 day
   - Silver: 7 days
   - Gold: 30 days
   - Platinum: 90 days
   - Diamond: 180 days

3. **Claim Badge**
   - Return to "Staking" tab
   - Click "Claim Badge"
   - Receive your NFT

4. **Unstake**
   - Click "Unstake"
   - Get your SGT back

### Method 2: Using Hardhat Console

```bash
npx hardhat console --network scrollSepolia
```

```javascript
const SGT = await ethers.getContractAt("ScrollGenToken", "0x...");
const Staking = await ethers.getContractAt("NFTStaking", "0x...");

// Approve and stake
await SGT.approve(Staking.target, ethers.parseEther("100"));
await Staking.stake(ethers.parseEther("100"));

// Advance time (testnet only)
await network.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [86400]); // 1 day
await network.provider.send("evm_mine");

// Claim badge
await Staking.claimBadge();

// Unstake
await Staking.unstake();
```
