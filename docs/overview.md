# ScrollGen Overview

## What is ScrollGen?

**ScrollGen** is a modular decentralized ecosystem built on the **Scroll zkEVM (Layer 2)** network. It represents a phased approach to building a complete Web3 protocol, starting with a simple ERC-20 token and evolving into a comprehensive ecosystem with NFTs, DAO governance, and DeFi capabilities.

## Vision

ScrollGen aims to empower the next generation of builders and communities on the Scroll network by providing:

- **Modular Architecture**: Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for organic growth
- **zkEVM Native**: Leveraging Scroll's zero-knowledge rollup technology for scalability and security
- **Community Driven**: Governance and decision-making power distributed to token holders
- **DeFi Integration**: Complete financial toolkit for users and developers

## Why Scroll zkEVM?

Scroll is an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution that uses zero-knowledge rollups to:

- **Reduce Transaction Costs**: Significantly lower gas fees compared to Ethereum mainnet
- **Increase Throughput**: Handle thousands of transactions per second
- **Maintain Security**: Inherit Ethereum's security through cryptographic proofs
- **EVM Compatibility**: Full compatibility with existing Ethereum tools and smart contracts

## Current Phase

### Phase 1: ScrollGen Token (SGT)

The foundation of the ecosystem is the ScrollGen Token (SGT), an ERC-20 token with:

- **Standard ERC-20 Functionality**: Transfer, approve, and transferFrom operations
- **Minting Capability**: Owner can mint new tokens to specific addresses
- **Burning Mechanism**: Token holders can burn their own tokens
- **Initial Supply**: 1,000,000 SGT tokens

**Deployed on**: Scroll Sepolia Testnet

## Roadmap

### Phase 2: NFT Layer (Planned)
- Dynamic NFT collection
- Metadata management
- Staking mechanisms for token holders
- Integration with marketplace protocols

### Phase 3: DAO Governance (Planned)
- Proposal creation and voting system
- Multi-signature treasury management
- Token-weighted governance
- Time-locked proposals for security

### Phase 4: DeFi Integration (Planned)
- Automated Market Maker (AMM) for liquidity
- Staking pools with rewards
- Yield farming opportunities
- Cross-protocol integrations
