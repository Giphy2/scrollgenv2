# Quest System & Gamified DeFi

## Overview

Gamification layer that transforms DeFi participation into an engaging quest system with evolving NFT badges, experience points, and tiered achievements.

## Purpose & Motivation

- **User Engagement**: Make DeFi fun and rewarding
- **Onboarding**: Guide new users through features
- **Retention**: Ongoing challenges keep users active
- **Community Building**: Shared goals and competition
- **Education**: Learn by doing with clear objectives

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract: QuestSystem.sol

**Core Components:**
1. Quest registry with progress tracking
2. Evolving NFT badge system
3. Experience points (XP) and leveling
4. Achievement tiers (Common to Legendary)
5. Reward distribution mechanism

### Data Structures

```solidity
struct Quest {
    uint256 questId;
    string name;
    string description;
    uint256 requiredProgress;
    uint256 rewardType;      // 0: Badge, 1: Tokens, 2: SP
    uint256 rewardAmount;
    bool active;
    uint256 participants;
    uint256 completions;
}

struct UserQuest {
    uint256 questId;
    uint256 progress;
    uint256 startTime;
    uint256 completionTime;
    bool completed;
    bool claimed;
}

struct Badge {
    uint256 badgeId;
    string name;
    uint256 tier;            // 1-5 (Common to Legendary)
    uint256 experience;
    uint256 level;           // 1-100
    uint256 mintTime;
    string metadataURI;
}
```

## Experience & Leveling System

### XP Sources

| 11-25 | Reduced trading fees (5%) |
| 26-50 | Priority customer support |
| 51-75 | Exclusive quest access |
| 76-99 | Governance bonus (10% voting weight) |
| 100 | Master badge, permanent benefits |

### Leveling Formula

```solidity
while (badge.experience >= EXP_PER_LEVEL && badge.level < MAX_LEVEL) {
    badge.experience -= EXP_PER_LEVEL;
    badge.level++;
}
```

## Quest Examples

### Beginner Quest: "First Steps"
```json
{
  "name": "First Steps",
  "description": "Complete your first stake on ScrollGen",
  "requiredProgress": 1,
  "rewardType": 0,
  "rewardAmount": 50,
  "tier": "Common"
}
```

### Advanced Quest: "Yield Master"
```json
{
  "name": "Yield Master",
  "description": "Earn 1,000 SGT from all DeFi activities",
  "requiredProgress": 1000,
  "rewardType": 1,
  "rewardAmount": 100,
  "tier": "Epic"
}
```

### Legendary Quest: "Protocol Guardian"
```json
{
  "name": "Protocol Guardian",
  "description": "Participate in 100 governance votes",
  "requiredProgress": 100,
  "rewardType": 2,
  "rewardAmount": 5000,
  "tier": "Legendary"
}
```

## Events

```solidity
event QuestCreated(uint256 indexed questId, string name, uint256 requiredProgress)
event QuestStarted(address indexed user, uint256 indexed questId, uint256 timestamp)
event QuestProgressUpdated(address indexed user, uint256 indexed questId, uint256 progress)
event QuestCompleted(address indexed user, uint256 indexed questId, uint256 timestamp)
event BadgeClaimed(address indexed user, uint256 indexed badgeId, uint256 tier)
event BadgeUpgraded(uint256 indexed badgeId, uint256 newLevel, uint256 newExperience)
```

## Frontend Integration

### QuestsInterface Component

**Features:**
- Quest browser with filters
- Progress bars and tracking
- Badge gallery with 3D models
- Leaderboards
- Achievement showcase

**User Flow:**
1. Browse available quests
2. Start quest to begin tracking
3. Complete activities (stake, trade, vote)
4. Monitor progress in real-time
5. Complete quest when ready
6. Claim NFT badge
7. View badge in collection
8. Earn XP to level up badge

## Gamification Mechanics

### Progress Bars
Visual feedback for quest completion percentage

### Streaks
Consecutive daily logins earn bonus XP

### Leaderboards
- Most quests completed
- Highest level badges
- Total XP earned
- Fastest completions

### Achievements
Secret achievements for special actions

### Social Sharing
Share badges on Twitter/Discord

### Challenges
Limited-time quests with exclusive rewards

## Reward Distribution

### On Completion
- NFT badge minted immediately
- Token rewards distributed from treasury
- ScrollPower added to zkID
- XP credited to account

### Batch Rewards
Admin can distribute rewards to multiple users efficiently

### Dynamic Rewards
Reward amounts can adjust based on difficulty and participation

## Security Considerations

### Quest Validation
- Progress updates from trusted sources
- Rate limiting on progress submissions
- Anti-cheat detection

### Badge Security
- ERC721 standard compliance
- Metadata immutability options
- Transfer restrictions (future: soulbound option)

### Reward Security
- Treasury funding verified
- Max reward limits per quest
- Emergency pause mechanism

### Exploit Prevention
- Cannot complete same quest twice
- Cannot claim badge before completion
- XP overflow protection
- Level cap enforcement

## Integration with Other Modules

### zkID Integration
```solidity
// Award ScrollPower for quest completion
zkIDVerifier.mintSP(user, spAmount, "Quest Completed");
```

### Token Integration
```solidity
// Distribute token rewards
sgtToken.transfer(user, rewardAmount);
```

### NFT Marketplace
```solidity
// Badges can be traded (if not soulbound)
marketplace.listNFT(badgeId, price);
```

## Testing Strategy

1. Quest creation and activation
2. Progress tracking accuracy
3. Completion triggers
4. Badge minting and metadata
5. XP calculation and leveling
6. Multiple users simultaneously
7. Edge cases (overflow, limits)
